# showrun-tcl

Work-in-Progress:

This is a rewrite of a program I had originally done in Javascript. I did not care for how much overhead there was with the Node.js app, ie. many steps for someone to use it. After looking at several scripting languages installed in OSX by default, I settled on Tcl.

Tcl is a nice language that doesn't get a lot of attention these days. The project is incomplete, for now.
